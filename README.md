# Implementation of A MODEL. 

- On this project I am going to practice the single responsability of the model in the MVC architecture. Following this convenctions given by the instructor:

A Model for Tic Tac Toe

The purpose of this exercise is to give you practice with implementing the Model component of the Model-View-Controller design pattern.

In the starter code, you are given an interface representing a game of Tic Tac Toe; your task is to implement the TicTacToe interface.

- You will need to define an enum Player, representing the players (X and O), with a toString() method that returns "X" and "O" accordingly. 
- You will need to implement the public class named TicTacToeModel, with a single public constructor that takes no arguments. 
- The class definition, with a toString() implementation to help with debugging, are provided to you in the starter code. 
- You will fill in the fields and remaining method definitions as appropriate. 
- You may also define other classes at your option as needed.

Game Grid Rules
- The game grid cells are numbered by row and column starting from 0. 
  - For example, the upper left position is row 0, column 0 (or [0][0] in the 2D array returned by getBoard()), 
  - the upper middle position is row 0, column 1 ([0][1]), 
  - the lower right is [2][2].
